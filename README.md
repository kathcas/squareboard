# squareboard
squareboard for charity fundraising

i intend to make it at 10 by 10 graph with labels for each square (ex: a8, g7)
i intend to make it so when a square has been taken, I can change the square's colour and update the name of whoever owns it
i intend to put an effect on the board once it is complete, and to add a date when the live will happen
